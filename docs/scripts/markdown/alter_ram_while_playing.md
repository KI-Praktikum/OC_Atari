`alter_ram_while_playing` is a script that allows you to play the game. 
It takes as argument (``-g``) the game that you want to play (e.g. `Pong`), as well as a potential list of RAM values (``-t``) that you want to be printed at each step.

You can pause the Game using `tab`. Once in pause mode, you can alter a RAM value using `enter`.
You will be asked with the position of the RAM that you want to modify, as well as the new value that you want to input. (You have to presse `enter` again to see if your alteration has modified e.g. an object color or position.)
